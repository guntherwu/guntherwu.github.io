Hello all!

I ran into an interesting situation with dates today. Are user head missed typed a seemingly validate my missing some separators and as result get past some bad data to the database. This failed thankfully. In an effort to prevent something like this happening in the future we devised a JavaScript solution seen below.

<p data-height="350" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="ClnAe" data-user="wboka" data-default-tab="js, result" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/wboka/pen/LXKVLb'>LXKVLb</a> by Wayne Boka (<a href='http://codepen.io/wboka'>@wboka</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a></p>
